# buutti-library
This is a recruitment programming exercise for Buutti completed by me in spring 2024.

## Description
This program is a book collection management software with both client and server included.
Features include:
- Browsing saved books
- Saving new books
- Modifying existing books
- Removing books from the collection

## Installation
Make sure you have an up-to-date version of node and npm. I used node v20.11.1 and npm 10.5.0. To install all required packages run
```
  npm i; cd backend; npm i; cd ../frontend; npm i; cd ..
```

## Running
To run the dev version of both the client and server use
```
npm run dev
```

To run only the dev client use
```
npm run clientdev
```

To run only the dev server use
```
npm run serverdev
```

The server runs on http://localhost:5000 and the client on http://localhost:3000
